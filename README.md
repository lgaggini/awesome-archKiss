# Awesome 4.x archKiss

This is my theme and configuration file for Awesome 4.x WM inspired by Archlinux dark colors and KISS (Keep it simple stupid) philosophy. 
It uses icons from other [great awesome themes](https://github.com/mikar/awesome-themes) (see credits for details).
I'm using it with ~~GTK adawaita dark theme~~ [Flat-Remix-Darkest](https://drasite.com/flat-remix-gtk) available for GTK 3 and GTK 2.
Recently I introduced some great ideas from [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).

## Configuration

I have some variables to control what to show in the panel bar on top, you can customize as you wish.
I have also some variables to control what default applications to use. In the configuration the default applications labels are used instead of program name,
e.g. browser instead of Chromium, so it remains quite solid.
By beautiful you can choose between three themes:
* theme_grey.lua: inspired on default awesome colors
* theme_dark.lua: a mix between awesome default colors and Archlinux colors
* theme_arch.lua: inspired by Archlinux colors
* theme_nature.lua: inspired by nature colors

```lua
-- Themes define colours, icons, and wallpapers
beautiful.init("/home/lg/.config/awesome/themes/kiss/theme_nature.lua")

-- User / hostname info

kernel_mon = true

-- Uptime
